        -> Cloud Computing Can Be Compared To Online Ride Services

    -> Cloud Offerings 

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS   

            -> Hardware (2 CPU - 4 GB RAM - 200 GB HDD)

        -> IAAS + PAAS => My Custom Solution For Client 

            -> Client needs a Web Application With MySQL Database

                -> Web Application: IAAS Service (Deploy Web Application) 

                -> Database: PAAS Service (Setup DB and Connect With Web Application Coming from IAAS)
