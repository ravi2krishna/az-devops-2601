    -> Azure Cloud 

        -> Applications have data 

            -> Data ?? 

                -> Data is in Server (Web Server, Database Server, File Storage Server etc)

            -> Server ??

                -> Server is a computer system, that takes a Request and send Response 

                -> Where are Servers ??

                    -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A Data Center is a building, a dedicated space within the building or 
        a group of buildings, used to house computer systems and associated components
        such as telecommunication and storage systems 

    -> Cons Of Physical Data Center 

        -> Buy Physical Place 
        -> Buy Devices [ CPU / RAM / HDD / Routers / Switches ]
        -> But Cables, AC's, Humidifiers etc 
        -> Human Resources [ Physical Security, System Admins, Networking Teams etc]
        -> etc 
    
    -> Cloud Data Center 

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> The Cloud refers to "On-Demand" availability of Compute Power, 
        Database Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a 
        Cloud Platform(Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI etc) via "Internet" with
        "Pay As You Go" Pricing

        -> Cloud Computing Can Be Compared To Online Ride Services

    -> Cloud Offerings 

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS   

            -> Hardware (2 CPU - 4 GB RAM - 200 GB HDD)

            -> Requirement is Setup MySQL Database 

                -> Prepare Private Subnets 
                -> Prepare Bastion / Jump 
                -> Prepare Private Instances 
                -> Setup OS - Ubuntu (Updates)
                -> Download MySQL Software
                -> Install MySQL Software
                -> Secure MySQL Software
                -> Backup Database

            -> VNET, VM etc 

        -> Platform As A Service - PAAS  

            -> Requirement is Setup MySQL Database 

            -> Azure Offers SQL Service(Select Database Type & Use)

        -> Software As A Service - SAAS 

            -> Direct Software (Subscribe & Pay)

    -> NOTE: Compare above to Online Ride Services like 
            Uber: Bikes, Cars, Autos
            Azure: IAAS, PAAS, SAAS 

        -> IAAS + PAAS => My Custom Solution For Client 

            -> Client needs a Web Application With MySQL Database

                -> Web Application: IAAS Service (Deploy Web Application) 

                -> Database: PAAS Service (Setup DB and Connect With Web Application Coming from IAAS)

============

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Physical Datacenters)

        -> Myntra Application (Ecommerce Platform)

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage 
                +
            -> Databases                =======>    Application (Ecommerce Platform / Any Application)
                +
            -> Networking 
                +
            -> Security 
                +
            -> etc 

    -> New Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Cloud Datacenters - AZURE)

        -> Myntra Application (Ecommerce Platform)

            -> Servers      -   Azure Virtual Machines Service
                +                       +
            -> Storage      -   Azure storage accounts Service
                +                       +
            -> Databases    -   Azure SQL Service                   =======>    Application (Ecommerce Platform / Any Application)
                +                       +
            -> Networking   -   Azure Virtual Networks Service
                +                       +
            -> Security     -   Azure Entra ID 
                +                       +
            -> etc          -   etc


    -> Once Application is built using Cloud Infrastructure

        -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

            -> High Availability - HA

                -> High Availability in Azure ensures Applications are continuously 
                    Accessible & Operational (24X7) i.e Uptime 99.9% and Above 

            -> Fault Tolerance - FT

                -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
                operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

            -> Scalability 

                -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
                increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

            -> Security 

                -> Security in Azure refers to measures taken to protect cloud Resources, Data and 
                Applications from Unauthorized Access 

    
    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

        -> Azure Global Infra - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/global-infrastructure/

        -> Azure Infrastructure is broken down into 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 
        
        -> Azure Cloud Computing resources(Servers, Databases, Storage etc) are 
        available across the world in different geographical locations i.e regions.

        -> To Utilize Azure Infrastructure we need to create Azure Account 

            -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account

                -> Email
                -> Mobile Number
                -> Card (2 INR for verification)

        -> Regions
            
            -> Azure Cloud Computing Resources or Data Centers are available in different Geographical Locations, 
            which are termed as REGIONS.

        -> Availability Zones 

            -> Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region.
