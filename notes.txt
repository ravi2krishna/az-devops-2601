    -> Azure Cloud 

        -> Applications have data 

            -> Data ?? 

                -> Data is in Server (Web Server, Database Server, File Storage Server etc)

            -> Server ??

                -> Server is a computer system, that takes a Request and send Response 

                -> Where are Servers ??

                    -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A Data Center is a building, a dedicated space within the building or 
        a group of buildings, used to house computer systems and associated components
        such as telecommunication and storage systems 

    -> Cons Of Physical Data Center 

        -> Buy Physical Place 
        -> Buy Devices [ CPU / RAM / HDD / Routers / Switches ]
        -> But Cables, AC's, Humidifiers etc 
        -> Human Resources [ Physical Security, System Admins, Networking Teams etc]
        -> etc 
    
    -> Cloud Data Center 

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> The Cloud refers to "On-Demand" availability of Compute Power, 
        Database Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a 
        Cloud Platform(Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI etc) via "Internet" with
        "Pay As You Go" Pricing

        -> Cloud Computing Can Be Compared To Online Ride Services

    -> Cloud Offerings 

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS   

            -> Hardware (2 CPU - 4 GB RAM - 200 GB HDD)

    -> Once Application is built using Cloud Infrastructure

        -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

            -> High Availability - HA

                -> High Availability in Azure ensures Applications are continuously 
                    Accessible & Operational (24X7) i.e Uptime 99.9% and Above 

            -> Fault Tolerance - FT

                -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
                operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

            -> Scalability 

                -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
                increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

            -> Security 

                -> Security in Azure refers to measures taken to protect cloud Resources, Data and 
                Applications from Unauthorized Access 

    
    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

        -> Azure Global Infra - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/global-infrastructure/

        -> Azure Infrastructure is broken down into 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 
        
        -> Azure Cloud Computing resources(Servers, Databases, Storage etc) are 
        available across the world in different geographical locations i.e regions.

        -> To Utilize Azure Infrastructure we need to create Azure Account 

            -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account

                -> Email
                -> Mobile Number
                -> Card (2 INR for verification)

        -> Regions
            
            -> Azure Cloud Computing Resources or Data Centers are available in different Geographical Locations, 
            which are termed as REGIONS.

        -> Availability Zones 

            -> Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region.

==============

    -> Azure Virtual Networks - VNET 

        -> A Virtual Network (VNET) in Azure is a foundational service that enables you to 
        build your own private network in the Azure cloud. 

        -> VNET lets you launch AZURE resources (servers, databases, applications etc) in a 
        logically isolated virtual network that you define.

        -> It is similar to having your own data center inside AZURE.

    -> Azure Subnet 

        -> A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. 
        You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. 

        -> Subnet Calculator 

            -> https://mattrickard.com/static/image/how-to-calculate-a-cidr/1.webp

    -> Azure Network Reserved IP's 

        -> Azure reserves the first four and last IP addresses for a total of 5 IP addresses 
        within each subnet.

        -> For example, the IP address range of 10.0.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:

            10.0.1.0 : Network address
            10.0.1.1 : Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
            10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3 : Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS
            10.0.1.255 : Network broadcast address.

                -> The addresses we can use are from only 10.0.1.4 - 10.0.1.254

        10.0.0.0/16 -> 65636

            10.0.0.0

13th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Route Tables 

        -> An Azure Route Table is a resource that controls network traffic flow 
        within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) by defining custom rules, 
        called User-Defined Routes (UDRs), which override default Azure system routes. 
        
        -> You associate a route table with subnets, directing traffic based on destination
        (IP address range) and next hop (e.g., a virtual appliance, gateway, or the internet) to enable granular control, security, and advanced network topologies like hub-and-spoke. 

    -> Considering Our VNET 

        -> We Want Two Types Of Traffic Flow 

            -> Public: Which should be Accessible From Internet 

                -> Web & Application Subnets

            -> Private: Which should not be Accessible From Internet 

                -> Database Subnet 

    -> Network Security Groups - NSG (Firewalls)

        -> Azure network security group is used to filter network traffic to and from 
        Azure resources in an Azure virtual network.

        -> A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny 
        inbound network traffic.

        -> For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

        -> Based On Application Requirements we define rules in NSG 

            -> Myntra Web NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) - Port 3389 
                -> HTTP Access (For Web Applications) - Port 80 
                -> HTTPS Access (For Web Applications Secured) - Port 443 

            -> Myntra App NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) - Port 3389 
                -> HTTP Access (For Backends / API) - Port 8080 (8000 - 3000 - 5000 etc)

            -> Myntra DB NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) - Port 3389 
                -> MySQL DB Access - Port 3306 

    -> Azure Public IP's 

        -> Public IP addresses allow Internet resources to communicate inbound to 
        Azure resources. Public IP addresses enable Azure resources to communicate to 
        Internet and public-facing Azure services.

            -> For Myntra Web Server we need an Public IP 

    -> Azure Network Interface Card - NIC 

        -> In Azure, a Network Interface (NIC) is a crucial resource that connects a 
        Virtual Machine (VM) to a Virtual Network (VNet), enabling communication 
        with the internet, other Azure services, and on-premises networks. 
        Each NIC acts as a virtual network adapter, allowing for IP configurations 
        (private/public, static/dynamic), association with Network Security Groups (NSGs) 
        for traffic filtering, and even multiple NICs per VM for advanced connectivity.


19th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Create PIP 

    -> Create NIC i.e Network Interface 

    -> Associate PIP & NSG 

    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's

        cloud that emulates a physical computer, giving you control over the OS and applications without 
        managing hardware.

    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's (Components)

    -> Requirement Given by EDIFY

    -> Edify is going to setup the LMS App environment i.e servers on AZURE 

    -> These servers are grouped into three subnets each with 4k servers

	-> First Subnet is for web servers, around 4k

	-> Second Subnet is for backend servers, around 4k

	-> Third Subnet is for database servers, around 4k

    -> In the future, they might add more number of subnets i.e cache subnets, load balancer subnet etc

    -> The web servers and app servers needs to be communicated from internet

	-> The database servers needs to be communicated only from App Servers, but not from internet

    -> Coming to security of Web Servers, they should have only 
		-> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
		-> HTTP traffic for clients from internet

	-> Coming to security of App Servers, they should have only 
		-> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
		-> HTTP traffic port 8080 for clients from internet
