    -> Azure Cloud 

        -> Applications have data 

            -> Data ?? 

                -> Data is in Server (Web Server, Database Server, File Storage Server etc)

            -> Server ??

                -> Server is a computer system, that takes a Request and send Response 

                -> Where are Servers ??

                    -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A Data Center is a building, a dedicated space within the building or 
        a group of buildings, used to house computer systems and associated components
        such as telecommunication and storage systems 

    -> Cons Of Physical Data Center 

        -> Buy Physical Place 
        -> Buy Devices [ CPU / RAM / HDD / Routers / Switches ]
        -> But Cables, AC's, Humidifiers etc 
        -> Human Resources [ Physical Security, System Admins, Networking Teams etc]
        -> etc 
    
    -> Cloud Data Center 

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> The Cloud refers to "On-Demand" availability of Compute Power, 
        Database Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a 
        Cloud Platform(Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI etc) via "Internet" with
        "Pay As You Go" Pricing

        -> Cloud Computing Can Be Compared To Online Ride Services

    -> Cloud Offerings 

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS   

            -> Hardware (2 CPU - 4 GB RAM - 200 GB HDD)

    -> Once Application is built using Cloud Infrastructure

        -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

            -> High Availability - HA

                -> High Availability in Azure ensures Applications are continuously 
                    Accessible & Operational (24X7) i.e Uptime 99.9% and Above 

            -> Fault Tolerance - FT

                -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
                operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

            -> Scalability 

                -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
                increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

            -> Security 

                -> Security in Azure refers to measures taken to protect cloud Resources, Data and 
                Applications from Unauthorized Access 

    
    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

        -> Azure Global Infra - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/global-infrastructure/

        -> Azure Infrastructure is broken down into 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 
        
        -> Azure Cloud Computing resources(Servers, Databases, Storage etc) are 
        available across the world in different geographical locations i.e regions.

        -> To Utilize Azure Infrastructure we need to create Azure Account 

            -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account

                -> Email
                -> Mobile Number
                -> Card (2 INR for verification)

        -> Regions
            
            -> Azure Cloud Computing Resources or Data Centers are available in different Geographical Locations, 
            which are termed as REGIONS.

        -> Availability Zones 

            -> Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region.

==============

    -> Azure Virtual Networks - VNET 

        -> A Virtual Network (VNET) in Azure is a foundational service that enables you to 
        build your own private network in the Azure cloud. 

        -> VNET lets you launch AZURE resources (servers, databases, applications etc) in a 
        logically isolated virtual network that you define.

        -> It is similar to having your own data center inside AZURE.

    -> Azure Subnet 

        -> A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. 
        You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. 

        -> Subnet Calculator 

            -> https://mattrickard.com/static/image/how-to-calculate-a-cidr/1.webp

    -> Azure Network Reserved IP's 

        -> Azure reserves the first four and last IP addresses for a total of 5 IP addresses 
        within each subnet.

        -> For example, the IP address range of 10.0.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:

            10.0.1.0 : Network address
            10.0.1.1 : Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
            10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3 : Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS
            10.0.1.255 : Network broadcast address.

                -> The addresses we can use are from only 10.0.1.4 - 10.0.1.254

        10.0.0.0/16 -> 65636

            10.0.0.0

13th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Route Tables 

        -> An Azure Route Table is a resource that controls network traffic flow 
        within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) by defining custom rules, 
        called User-Defined Routes (UDRs), which override default Azure system routes. 
        
        -> You associate a route table with subnets, directing traffic based on destination
        (IP address range) and next hop (e.g., a virtual appliance, gateway, or the internet) to enable granular control, security, and advanced network topologies like hub-and-spoke. 

    -> Considering Our VNET 

        -> We Want Two Types Of Traffic Flow 

            -> Public: Which should be Accessible From Internet 

                -> Web & Application Subnets

            -> Private: Which should not be Accessible From Internet 

                -> Database Subnet 

    -> Network Security Groups - NSG (Firewalls)

        -> Azure network security group is used to filter network traffic to and from 
        Azure resources in an Azure virtual network.

        -> A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny 
        inbound network traffic.

        -> For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

        -> Based On Application Requirements we define rules in NSG 

            -> Myntra Web NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) - Port 3389 
                -> HTTP Access (For Web Applications) - Port 80 
                -> HTTPS Access (For Web Applications Secured) - Port 443 

            -> Myntra App NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) - Port 3389 
                -> HTTP Access (For Backends / API) - Port 8080 (8000 - 3000 - 5000 etc)

            -> Myntra DB NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) - Port 3389 
                -> MySQL DB Access - Port 3306 

    -> Azure Public IP's 

        -> Public IP addresses allow Internet resources to communicate inbound to 
        Azure resources. Public IP addresses enable Azure resources to communicate to 
        Internet and public-facing Azure services.

            -> For Myntra Web Server & App Server we need an Public IP as they are internet facing entities

    -> Azure Network Interface Card - NIC 

        -> In Azure, a Network Interface (NIC) is a crucial resource that connects a 
        Virtual Machine (VM) to a Virtual Network (VNet), enabling communication 
        with the internet, other Azure services, and on-premises networks. 
        Each NIC acts as a virtual network adapter, allowing for IP configurations 
        (private/public, static/dynamic), association with Network Security Groups (NSGs) 
        for traffic filtering, and even multiple NICs per VM for advanced connectivity.


19th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Create PIP 

    -> Create NIC i.e Network Interface 

    -> Associate PIP & NSG 

    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's 

        -> An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is a scalable, on-demand computing resource in the Microsoft Azure 
        cloud that emulates a physical computer, giving you control over the OS and applications without 
        managing hardware.

    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's (Components)

    -> Requirement Given by EDIFY

    -> Edify is going to setup the LMS App environment i.e servers on AZURE 

    -> These servers are grouped into three subnets each with 4k servers

	-> First Subnet is for web servers, around 4k

	-> Second Subnet is for backend servers, around 4k

	-> Third Subnet is for database servers, around 4k

    -> In the future, they might add more number of subnets i.e cache subnets, load balancer subnet etc

    -> The web servers and app servers needs to be communicated from internet

	-> The database servers needs to be communicated only from App Servers, but not from internet

    -> Coming to security of Web Servers, they should have only 
		-> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
		-> HTTP traffic for clients from internet
        -> HTTPS traffic for clients from internet

	-> Coming to security of App Servers, they should have only 
		-> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet

    -> GUI: Beginners 

    -> CLI: Intermediate 

    -> Code: Professional (DevOps)

    -> Infrastructure As Code - IaC (Pro/Expert)

        -> Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer 
        data center resources through machine-readable definition files(CODE/SCRIPT), 
        rather than physical hardware configuration(GUI) or 
        interactive configuration tools(Azure CLI).

        -> IaC Concept 

            -> The IaC model approaches networks, servers, databases, and other resources 
            in a descriptive manner via "versioning" (similar to using VCS in Development, 
            in DevOps we are tracking infrastructure code). 

                -> Like Developers write "Application Code" to Build Applications

                    -> Technologies - Java, Python, Node etc
                
                -> As DevOps Engineers, will be writing "Infrastructure Code/Scripts" to 
                    Build Infrastructure

                    -> Tools / Services - Azure ARM Templates, AWS Cloudformation Templates etc

    -> Azure ARM Templates  

        -> An Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
        file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your Azure project 
        using a declarative syntax. It allows you to provision, manage, and deploy 
        all the necessary resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation, 
        ensuring consistency and repeatability across different environments.

==============

    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's 

        -> An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is a scalable, on-demand computing resource in the Microsoft Azure 
        cloud that emulates a physical computer, giving you control over the OS and applications without 
        managing hardware.

    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's (Components)

    -> Web Servers 

    -> App Servers 

    -> Database Servers

    -> Web Servers

        -> A web server is computer software that accepts requests via HTTP 
        to distribute web content.

        -> Nginx Web Server is popular for hosting Websites 

        -> Earlier we used username and password to Connect with server

        -> Now we are going to use username and key to Connect with server

        -> Key pair: Public Key(cloud) & Private Key(downloaded in your system) 

        -> To Authenticate Server we use Private Key(.pem file)

    -> To Login With Private Key 

        -> Terminal / Command Prompt and connect 

            -> ssh -i private_key username@public-ip 

        -> https://ssheasy.com/ 

    -> To Know which service is currently running on server 

        -> sudo ss -ntpl 

    -> Web Servers Run on port 80 over HTTP protocol

    -> Installing Nginx Web Server 

        -> sudo apt update -y 
        -> sudo apt install nginx -y 
        -> sudo ss -ntpl 
        -> Browse Public IP 
    
    -> Deploy Application 

        -> Application Code - https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm.git 

        -> Every Web Server has Document Root i.e location where code should be placed 

            -> /var/www/html 
            -> ls /var/www/html
            -> cat /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
            -> sudo git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm.git /var/www/html 
            -> sudo rm -r /var/www/html/* 
            -> ls /var/www/html
            -> sudo git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm.git /var/www/html 

    -> To take the backup process for above Application, We can create Custom Images 

    -> Create Image Gallery and Store Custom Image 

        -> Azure compute galleries

        
28th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Azure Disks 

        -> When we create VM, primary disk will be assigned based on the Zone Where VM is launched 

        -> While Creating VM, by default Primary Disk i.e OS Disk will be applied and optionally
        you can add Secondary Disks i.e Data Disks or Attach Existing Disks 

        -> NOTE: Availability Zones and Server Zones are Locked With Each Other 

        -> Create Disk 
        -> Attach Disk 
        -> Detach Disk 
        -> Delete Disk

        -> Modifying Disk 

            -> Only Scaling Up is Possible 
            -> No Scaling Down 
            -> Changing Zone is not possible 

29th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Azure Disk is Purely Server Based Storage 

    -> Without Azure Disk, We cannot setup Servers / Virtual Machines (OS Disk is must)

    -> Azure Disk Design Principal (Limitations)

        -> Using Azure Disk We cannot directly work with Internet Based Storage 

        -> Using Azure Disk we cannot get data across multiple zones 

        -> Using Azure Disk we cannot scale down, only scale up is possible and need to pay 
        complete storage charges, regardless we use it or not 

        -> Costlier in terms of price 

        -> 500 GB Azure Disk - $22 
    
    -> Storage Center / Blob Storage

        -> Azure Blob Storage provides scalable, cost-efficient object storage in the cloud. 
        Store and access unstructured data for your most demanding workloads.

        -> Using Blob Storage we can overcome above issues 

        -> Blob Storage cannot be used as OS Disk 

        -> Blob Storage supports internet based access directly, no need of any computer resource 
        like virtual machines 

        -> Price is cheaper Compared to Azure Disks 

        -> 500 GB Blob Storage - $11 

        -> When you have vast amount of static assets, go for Blob Storage
            (images, videos, documents pdf, doc files etc)

            -> https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/blob_storage_architecture-2.png

        -> We Have Containers & Blobs 

    -> Manage Blob Storage From VM'scalable
    
    -> Using CLI Creating Azure Resources 

        -> Install Azure CLI (Win)

        -> Install Azure CLI (Linux) : curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

    -> To Login With Your Account 

        -> az login --use-device-code 

        az storage blob upload \
    --account-name mystorage9989 \
    --container-name images \
    --name vm.txt \
    --file vm.txt \
    --account-key update-key-here

    -> Access / Update Using Browser 

        -> Directly via browser 

    -> Access / Update Using Server (CLI)

        -> Download Azure CLI 

    -> Access / Update Using Workstation 

        -> Download Azure Storage Explorer 

        -> Connect To Azure Resources 

            -> Connection String 


2nd Feb 2026
==============

    -> Azure File Shares 

        -> An Azure File Share provides fully managed, enterprise-grade cloud file shares
        accessible via industry-standard protocols (SMB/NFS) from Windows, Linux.

        -> Attach Network File Storage for Virtual Machines  

    -> Create VM 

    -> Create File Share in Storage Account 

    -> Connect File Share With VM 

    -> To enable static website hosting, select a storage account. 
    In the left navigation pane, select Static website rom the Data management group.
    

    -> Security 

        -> Identity Level

            -> Microsoft Entra ID: Manage Identities In Azure 

            -> Create Users 

            -> Assign Permissions Using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) 
            has several Azure built-in roles that you can assign to users

            -> Adding Azure identity roles involves navigating to the "Access control (IAM)" 
            section of a resource, subscription, or management group in the Azure portal, 
            clicking "Add" and "Add role assignment," selecting the desired role 
            (e.g., Contributor, Owner), and choosing the user, group, or service principal

        -> Network Level 


3rd Feb 2026
==============

    -> Network Level 

    -> Security For Virtual Machines 

        -> When we are talking about increased security, what we want to focus on is, 
        placing of Virtual Machines that hold sensitive data in Private Subnets 

        -> However this causes some issue

            -> We cannot serve traffic from private instances as there is no route to 
            the open internet and also we cannot access Virtual Machines that are 
            in Private Subnets 

    -> Azure Bastion 

        -> The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service 
        that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and 
        seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal

        -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/c44e78bb-bfe1-47a6-b250-0643e0f6c3bd.webp

        -> To Test Launch Public and Private Virtual Machines 

            -> Accessing Public Virtual Machines - Works 

            -> Accessing Private Virtual Machines - Fails  

        -> Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines by secure and seamless RDP & SSH connectivity
        without the need to expose them through public IP addresses. 
        Deploying will automatically create a Bastion host on a subnet in your virtual network.


4th Feb 2026
==============

    -> Accessing Private Server Using Bastion 

    -> Take the Private IP Of Public Server and add SSH Rule in Private Server 

        -> SSH -> Port 22 -> Allow From Private IP Of Public Server

    -> Application Server: Frontend To Take Request 

        -> Public Server 

        -> Java App Server i.e Apache Tomcat Server 

        -> Apache Tomcat Server Runs On Port 8080

        -> It enhances security by masking origin server IPs, 
        improves performance via caching/compression, and provides load balancing 
        to distribute traffic, with popular examples including 
        Nginx, HAProxy, Cloudflare, and AWS Elastic Load Balancer. 

    -> Key functions of a reverse proxy include:
        
        -> Load Balancing: Distributes client requests across multiple backend servers to 
        prevent overload and ensure high availability.
        -> Security & Protection: Acts as a buffer against attacks, 
        shielding backend servers from direct exposure, and enables SSL/TLS termination.
        -> Performance Optimization: Improves speed through caching, content compression, 
        and web acceleration.
        -> Centralized Authentication: Simplifies management by handling security policies 
        at the edge.

    -> Fault Tolerance 

        -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
        operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

    -> Scalability 

        -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
        increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

    -> Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
    
        -> VMSS you create and manage a group of load balanced virtual machines (VM) instances.
        The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to 
        demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide the following key benefits:

            -> Easy to create and manage multiple VMs
            -> Provides high availability and application resiliency by 
            distributing VMs across availability zones or fault domains
            -> Allows your application to automatically "scale" as resource demand changes
            -> Works at large-scale

            -> The Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) is a process followed by 
            Software Development Teams To Design, Develop & Test High Quality Softwares.

            -> SDLC consists of multiple stages 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Deploy 

                -> NOTE: From DevOps Context

==============

    -> Project - 1

        -> LMS Project 

            -> Development Team 

                -> Mainly Builds Application 

                -> Development Means Coding 

    -> Version Control Systems (VCS)

        ->  Version control / Revision control / Source control
        is a "process" that helps to "keep track of changes" made to 
        files (computer programs, web site files, documents etc)

        -> https://www.sirhow.com/uploads/2023/07/check-gpay-transaction-history-step-4.jpg

        -> Advantage Of VCS is Revert Changes To Previous Working Versions, 
        if there are issues in new version

            -> Transaction ID's (Google Pay) == Commit ID's (VCS)

    -> To Implement Version Control System, we need "Git" Software 

        -> Google Pay Generates Transaction ID's

        -> Git Generates Commit ID's 

        -> Git helps in tracking code / changes in your code 

        -> Git tracks code in your laptop 

        -> Git will generate commit id for every change we make 

    -> All the transactions made will be stored in Server(Database), similarly
    we store all our commit id's in Source Code Management (SCM) like a Server

        -> NOTE: Mobile PHone -> Google Pay -> Bank Server (Transaction ID's)

        -> NOTE: Developer Laptop -> Git -> GitHub (Commit ID's)

    -> GitHub - Server Side Software - Organizations 

        -> GitHub Provides a platform to store code and it's versions 

        -> GitHub Stores all the versions of the code in Centralized Location (github.com)

    -> NOTE: Example of a Real World Application 

        -> https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ - APP 

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus - CODE

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commits/master/ - COMMITS 

    
    -> Repository 

        -> A "repository" contains all of your "project's files" and each file's revision history. 
        Developers can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

            -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus 

            -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/17520 

    -> JIRA 

        -> Jira is a proprietary product developed by Atlassian that allows 
        bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management.

        -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xjcz23wx147q/2vuHCsAF3tUpzYykEb9GAX/11fb10694a339636aceb9f531f11e49f/Kanban-updated.png

    -> GitHub Projects & Issues 

        -> GitHub Projects are a feature within GitHub designed for planning and tracking work

        -> GitHub Issues is a built-in, lightweight issue-tracking system in every repository 
        used for planning, discussing, and tracking work like 
        bug reports, new features, and tasks.

        -> NOTE: We have Projects and within Projects we have Issues 

    -> Project - 1 

        -> Start LMS Project (Development)

            -> Create GitHub Account - https://github.com/

            -> Developers Will Update Code (PUSH) To GitHub Repository 

18th Feb 2026
==============

    -> Branches 

        -> Git branches are lightweight, movable pointers to snapshots of your codebase 
        
        -> Branches allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on 
        new features or bug fixes in isolation. This capability is a core feature of Git, 
        facilitating parallel development "without affecting the stability of the main project".

        -> Branches let you experiment and make changes in a contained area of the repository,
        keeping the main (or master) branch clean and functional.
